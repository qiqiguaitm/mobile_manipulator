# Ground collision protection configuration
# Prevents the robot arm from hitting the ground

# Ground parameters
ground_height: -0.05      # Height relative to base_link (m), -50mm for safety margin
ground_size_x: 10.0       # Ground size in X direction (m)
ground_size_y: 10.0       # Ground size in Y direction (m)  
ground_thickness: 0.1     # Ground thickness for collision detection (m)

# Enable ground collision protection on startup
enable_on_startup: true

# Workspace constraints (optional, for additional safety)
workspace_constraints:
  min_z: 0.1             # Minimum end-effector height above ground (m)
  max_reach: 1.0         # Maximum reach from base (m)
