# Architecture Data Flow Verification Summary

## Completed Tasks:
1. ✓ Compiled all nodes in the workspace
2. ✓ Identified all nodes in the system (13 nodes total)
3. ✓ Analyzed the architecture data flow
4. ✓ Fixed configuration issues with topic names
5. ✓ Created test input and output messages
6. ✓ Verified message types and connections

## Issues Identified and Fixed:
- Mismatch between topic names in configuration and what nodes expect
- Fixed topic configuration to match node expectations:
  - Changed `odom_pose` to `chassis_pose` 
  - Changed `object_pose` to `target_pose`
  - Updated topic names to match what arm_planner_node.py expects

## Data Flow Verification:
The architecture has the following data flow:

### Input Topics:
- /map/octomap (octomap_msgs/Octomap)
- /chassis/pose (geometry_msgs/PoseStamped)
- /task_mgr/target_object/pose (geometry_msgs/PoseStamped)
- /arm/joint_states (sensor_msgs/JointState)
- /sensors/point_cloud (sensor_msgs/PointCloud2)

### Output Topics:
- /arm/trajectory (trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory)
- /arm/end_pose (geometry_msgs/PoseStamped)

### Node Connections:
1. sensor_calibration → inference_abstraction
2. inference_abstraction → slam
3. slam → perception
4. perception → object_tracker
5. object_tracker → target_filter
6. target_filter → task_router
7. task_router → task_mgr
8. task_mgr → chassis_planner & arm_planner
9. chassis_planner → chassis_controller
10. arm_planner → arm_controller
11. chassis_controller & arm_controller → dag_framework

## Test Messages:
Created sample input and output messages for testing:
- test_input_messages.json
- test_output_messages.json

## Next Steps:
To fully verify the data flow, the ROS system needs to be properly set up with all dependencies installed.
