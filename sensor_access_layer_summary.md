# Sensor Access Layer Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks:

1. Added chassis access layer implementation:
   - Enhanced the chassis_controller_node.py with proper state tracking and TF broadcasting
   - Updated package.xml and CMakeLists.txt to include tf dependency

2. Added Lidar access layer implementation:
   - Created lidar_driver package with package.xml, CMakeLists.txt, and setup.py
   - Implemented lidar_driver_node.py to simulate LIDAR data using LaserScan messages
   - Added launch file and topic configuration

3. Added camera access layer implementation:
   - Created camera_driver package with package.xml, CMakeLists.txt, and setup.py
   - Implemented camera_driver_node.py to simulate camera data using Image messages
   - Added launch file and topic configuration

4. Added IMU access layer implementation:
   - Created imu_driver package with package.xml, CMakeLists.txt, and setup.py
   - Implemented imu_driver_node.py to simulate IMU data using Imu messages
   - Added launch file and topic configuration

5. Implemented access layer modules:
   - All sensor drivers are implemented as standalone ROS nodes
   - Each driver publishes data to appropriate topics
   - Added proper configuration files for each package

6. Compiled and verified correctness:
   - Successfully built all packages using catkin_make
   - Verified Python syntax for all new scripts
   - Integrated all sensor drivers into the main launch file

## Integration Details:

- All sensor drivers are integrated into the main agilex_demo.launch file
- Each driver publishes to standardized topics:
  - Lidar: /sensors/lidar/scan
  - Camera: /sensors/camera/image_raw
  - IMU: /sensors/imu/data
- The enhanced chassis controller now properly tracks robot state and broadcasts TF transforms
