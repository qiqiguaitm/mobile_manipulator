# Real Sensor Data Access Layer Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks:

1. **IMU Access Layer**:
   - Modified existing serial_imu package to work with real IMU device on /dev/ttyUSB0
   - Updated device path from "/dev/imu" to "/dev/ttyUSB0"
   - Verified data is being received from the IMU device
   - IMU driver publishes real sensor data to /imu/data topic

2. **Camera Access Layer**:
   - Created a real camera driver using OpenCV to access USB camera devices
   - Driver supports configurable device ID, frame rate, and resolution
   - Publishes image data to /camera/image_raw topic
   - Also publishes camera info to /camera/camera_info topic
   - Driver properly handles camera initialization and cleanup

3. **LIDAR Access Layer**:
   - Created a LIDAR driver using pointcloud_to_laserscan package
   - Converts 3D point cloud data to 2D laser scan data
   - Publishes laser scan data to /scan topic
   - Designed to work with any point cloud source on /camera/depth/color/points

4. **Integration**:
   - Updated main launch file to include all real sensor drivers
   - All drivers are configured to work with actual hardware
   - No simulated/fake data - all drivers access real sensors

5. **Compilation**:
   - Successfully rebuilt entire workspace with all changes
   - All packages compile without errors
   - Python syntax verified for all new scripts

## Hardware Verification:

- IMU: Confirmed data is being received from device on /dev/ttyUSB0
- Camera: Driver ready to access real USB camera devices (/dev/video0, /dev/video1, etc.)
- LIDAR: Ready to convert real point cloud data to laser scans

## Usage:

To run the complete system with real sensors:
```bash
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch agilex_demo.launch
```

The system will automatically:
1. Start the IMU driver to read from /dev/ttyUSB0
2. Start the camera driver to read from /dev/video0
3. Start the LIDAR driver to convert point clouds to laser scans
4. All other components of the robot system
