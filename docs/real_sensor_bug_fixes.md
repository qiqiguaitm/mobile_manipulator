# Real Sensor Data Access Layer - Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Launch File Path Issue**: 
   - Fixed `run_all.sh` script to properly launch the agilex_demo.launch file
   - Changed from incorrect package-based launch to direct file path launch

2. **IMU Package Reference Issue**:
   - Fixed launch file to reference `serial_imu` package instead of non-existent `imu` package
   - Updated include statement from `imu/imu_msg.launch` to `serial_imu/imu_msg.launch`

3. **XML Syntax Error**:
   - Fixed missing closing `</launch>` tag in lidar_driver.launch file
   - Added proper XML closure to prevent parsing errors

4. **Missing OpenCV Dependency**:
   - Updated camera driver to handle missing OpenCV gracefully
   - Added fallback to publish dummy images when OpenCV is not available
   - Made camera driver robust against missing dependencies

5. **Workspace Integration**:
   - Copied `serial_imu` package from parent workspace to current workspace
   - Rebuilt entire workspace to ensure all packages are properly compiled

## Current Status:

The system should now launch correctly with:
```bash
./run_all.sh
```

All sensor drivers are integrated:
- IMU driver reads from real hardware on /dev/ttyUSB0
- Camera driver works with or without OpenCV (publishes dummy images if OpenCV missing)
- LIDAR driver converts point clouds to laser scans

## Next Steps:

To fully utilize real sensors:
1. Install OpenCV if you want real camera data: `sudo apt-get install python3-opencv`
2. Ensure IMU device permissions: `sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0`
3. Connect actual camera devices to /dev/video* nodes
4. Connect LIDAR or depth camera for point cloud data
