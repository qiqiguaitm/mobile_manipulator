# Perception Node Library Conflict Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified
The perception node was experiencing a library conflict error:
```
/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libp11-kit.so.0: undefined symbol: ffi_type_pointer, version LIBFFI_BASE_7.0
```

This was caused by mixed Python environments where:
- System ROS libraries were conflicting with conda-installed libraries
- The system was trying to resolve symbols from different library versions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Environment Isolation
Modified the perception node to isolate library loading by:
- Removing conda paths from sys.path to prevent library conflicts
- Prioritizing system paths for ROS and system libraries
- Adding debug logging for path management

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
Improved error handling throughout the perception node:
- Added specific ImportError handling for cv_bridge imports
- Added detection for symbol lookup errors
- Improved error messages for library conflicts
- Enhanced callback error handling with specific symbol lookup error detection

### 3. Robust Library Loading
- Created `safe_import_cv_bridge()` function for safer library imports
- Added better initialization of CvBridge with error recovery
- Improved camera subscriber initialization with specific error handling

### 4. Graceful Degradation
- The node continues to run and publish fixed pose messages even when image processing is disabled
- More informative error messages when library conflicts occur
- Runtime error recovery to disable image processing if persistent errors occur

## Files Modified
- `/home/agilex/AgileXDemo/catkin_ws/src/perception/scripts/perception_node.py` - Enhanced library isolation and error handling
- `/home/agilex/AgileXDemo/perception_node_library_conflict_fix.md` - Documentation of the fix

## Expected Outcome
The perception node should now run properly even when there are library conflicts between system and conda environments, with graceful degradation when image processing cannot be initialized.
